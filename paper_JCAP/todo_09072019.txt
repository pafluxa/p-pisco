1) rotate rho and sigma unit vectors in Figure 1

2) caption for Figure 6 needs work
-> Figure 6 should either show two plots (one power spectra, one residual) or not mention the second plot at all.
   Plotting the residual would be much better.

3) Rework Sections 7.2.3 and 8.
-> For section 7.2.3, I need to make clear that the effect of a realisitc mismatch is so small that it cannot be detected.
   Argue that mismatch produces an effect that is similar to pointing mismatch, but symmetric (see Mike's plot 
   for the quadrupolar pattern) around the pixel center, and so it tends to be averaged down.

4) Add the missing citations. 
-> A lot of citations are missing, particularly at the introduction.

# "newer stuff
5) Change the abstract
-> Particularly, roll-back to "present a new software tool"

6) Graduate.
