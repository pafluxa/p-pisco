General:

- Modify pipeline to extract power spectra from PISCO generated maps using Duncan's code.
- Check GRASP beams match Moon beams. (halfway done)
- Create mock pointing assuming featureless sky (much faster). Be careful not to include `zeta` here. Make sure to use T=720.
- Check generated pointing is fine by looking at declination limits, and by making the polarization angle coverage histogram.

For validation (Section 5)

- Re-run the CLASS simulation using the mock pointing and Moon subtracted beam parameters. This is the "perfect era 2 run".

For application (Section 6)

- Rolo suggested running two more simulations. One with no beam mismatch, but a few detectors off, "a la era1". He believes using 
  beam offsets from era2 should be fine.
- Second simulation should add calibration errors (changing `epsilon` in equation 3.9).

For discussion (Section 7)

- Compare the effects of having incomplete pairing with calibration errors.
