## Description
This file contains a configuration to perform a simulation using 1 week of pointing data sampletd at 20Hz,
generated by `generate_pointing_fast.py`. 

## Pointing
1 week of data sampled at 20 Hz. Seven boresight angles. Full focal plane pointing.

## Detectors
All feeds and all pairs. Pointing comes from era2 Moon measurements. Pairs within a feedhorn
share the same pointing, computed as the average of the two individual pointings.

## Beams
All beams are circularly symmetric Gaussians.

## Input CMB
CMB without B-modes, NSIDE=128, Planck LCDMM cosmology.
