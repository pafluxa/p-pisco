Cosmic microwave background experiments have experienced an exponential increase in complexity, data size and sensitivity. Current and future experiments aim at characterizing the B-mode power spectrum which, due to its faintness, will require extreme control over systematic effects. One of such effects might arise by the complex coupling between the telescope beam and its scanning strategy. In this work, we present a new software tool, the Pixel Space COnvolver, PISCO, capable of producing mock data streams for a general CMB experiment. We show results of an application of PISCO to the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveryor, and its Q-band telescope. Results show that beam eccentricity might cause a temperature to polarization leakage above $\ell \approx 50$.
